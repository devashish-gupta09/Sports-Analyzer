# Sports-Analyzer
Sports Analyzer provides a multi-dimensional way to analyze, view and process 
the performance data as per the need of the user. This program works in multiple 
sports categories including: Football, Basketball, Cricket. It uses real-time match 
stats to analyze the data and using its sorting algorithms it processes it into 
various sub categories where a user can view top stats as per need. 

The current program uses latest stats from different leagues which are:
1. Euro 2020 (Football)
2. NBA 2020 (Basketball)
3. IPL 2020 (Cricket)

Using various principles of Object-Oriented programming the data has been 
divided into various classes and sub classes which not only makes it easy to 
maintain but also reduces chances of errors in arranging the data.

This project is aimed to provide a tool for free and easy statistical analysis and gathering data 
related to different sports and sportspersons. The purpose of this project entitled as “SPORTS 
ANALYZER” is to computerize all the analytical activities by developing various algorithms 
using different data structures and classes.
